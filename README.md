# Nick's Home Assistant Configuration

This is my Home Assistant configuration for my smart home setup. 

I have installed [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) as a docker container on a HP Microserver Gen8 running Debian 10.

Within my house I am controlling various smart devices via Home Assistant such as:
* [Philips Hue Lights](https://www.philips-hue.com)
* [Logitech Harmony Hub](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/harmony-hub)
* [Broadlink RM Wifi + IR + RF Remote Controller](http://www.ibroadlink.com/rm/)
* [Xiaomi Aqara Gateway](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/xiaomi_aqara/)
* [Tasmota Devices](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/)
