# so3n's Home Assistant Configuration

This is my Home Assistant configuration for my smart home setup. 

I have installed [hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) on a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Within my house I am controlling various smart devices via Home Assistant such as:
* [Lifx lights](https://www.lifx.com.au/)
* [Logitech Harmony Hub](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/harmony-hub)
* [Broadlink RM Wifi + IR + RF Remote Controller](http://www.ibroadlink.com/rm/)
* [Xiaomi Aqara Gateway](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/xiaomi_aqara/)
